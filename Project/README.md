### ðŸŽ¼ Teaches the Basics of Music Theory
- Key Signature Identifier: The app will correlate a key signature with potential keys that match it.
  
### ðŸ•˜ History and Review Interface

## ðŸ‘¤ Who Will Use It?
Music students or enthusiasts who want to learn and improve their basic music theory skills.

## ðŸ’¡ Why is this Project of Interest?
As a music theory student at UBC, I often use online resources to learn concepts like intervals, key signatures, and note identification. However, these sites sometimes lack user-friendliness. My goal is to create an improved, distraction-free app that brings together essential music theory concepts in one place, making it convenient for students to learn.
